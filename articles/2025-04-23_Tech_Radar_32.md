Here is a summary of each blip from the Technology Radar Vol. 32 document, organized by quadrant and ring:

## Techniques

### Adopt

* **4. [Threat modeling][1]**:
  * Regularly identify and classify potential security threats throughout the software lifecycle, crucial in the AI-driven landscape.

### Trial

* **5. [API request collection as API product artifact][2]**:
  * Treat API request collections (like Postman) as key documentation to improve developer onboarding.
* **6. [Architecture advice process][3]**:
  * Decentralize architectural decisions, allowing anyone to make them after seeking advice from relevant parties.
* **8. [Just-in-time privileged access management (JIT PAM)][4]**
  * Grant privileged access only when needed and revoke it immediately after to minimize security exposure

### Assess

* **13. [AI-friendly code design][5]**:
  * Apply good software design principles (expressive naming, modularity, DRY) to improve maintainability by both humans and AI coding assistants.
* **15. [Competence envelope as a model for understanding system failures][6]**:
  * Analyze system robustness by understanding the boundary (competence envelope) within which it can handle failures gracefully.
  * Related to 📘 [Residuality Theory][residuality_theory]

### Hold
* **18. [Complacency with AI-generated code][7]**:
  * Be wary of over-reliance on AI coding assistants, which can lead to reduced critical thinking and poor code quality if not reviewed diligently.

## Platforms

### Trial
* **26. [Dapr][8]**: 
  * Evolving distributed application runtime for building resilient microservices with features like job scheduling and virtual actors.
* **27. Grafana Alloy**:
  * Open-source OpenTelemetry Collector (formerly Grafana Agent) as an all-in-one solution for collecting logs, metrics, and traces.
* **28. Grafana Loki**:
  * Scalable log aggregation system, inspired by Prometheus, which indexes metadata rather than full logs for cost efficiency.
* **29. Grafana Tempo**:
  * High-scale distributed tracing backend supporting OpenTelemetry, designed for cost-efficient, long-term trace storage and analysis.

### Assess
* **36. [Deno][9]**: 
  * Modern JavaScript/TypeScript runtime as an alternative to Node.js, featuring better security, native TS support, and now Node.js compatibility.
  * Interesting links to [Polyglot Programming][polyglot_programming]
* **40. [Model Context Protocol (MCP)][10]**:
  * Open standard for integrating LLM applications with external data sources (wikis, issue trackers) to provide better context.
* **42. pg_mooncake**: 
  * PostgreSQL extension adding columnar storage (using Iceberg/Delta Lake) and vectorized execution for heavy data analytics within Postgres.
* **43. Reasoning models**: 
  * Distinct category of LLMs (like o1, DeepSeek R1) for complex tasks requiring step-by-step thinking, despite higher latency/cost.
* **44. Restate**:
  * Durable execution platform (similar to Temporal) for building stateful, resilient applications using workflows-as-code and event processing.

## Tools

### Adopt
* **51. [Renovate][11]**: 
  * Tool for proactive, customizable dependency version management across various project types and hosting platforms.
  * See also [Automatic merging of dependency update PRs](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/automatic-merging-of-dependency-update-prs)
* **53. Vite**:
  * High-performance front-end build tool, known for fast hot-reloading, now a default choice for many frameworks.

### Trial
* **57. D2**: 
  * Diagrams-as-code tool with a readable scripting language for creating software documentation and architecture diagrams
* **60. MailSlurp**: 
  * Email and SMS API service to simplify testing workflows involving email/SMS verification via its API or dashboard.
* **61. Metabase**: 
  * Open-source BI tool for visualizing, analyzing, and sharing data insights via dashboards, with embedding capabilities.
* **64. OpenRewrite**: 
  * Tool for large-scale, automated code refactoring based on predefined recipes, especially useful for API migrations or framework updates.
* **66. Software engineering agents**: 
  * Supervised agentic modes in IDEs (like Cursor, Cline) where AI assists with implementation via chat, executing commands and fixing errors.

### Assess

* **76. OpenRouter**: 
  * Unified API gateway for accessing multiple LLMs, simplifying provider switching and potentially optimizing costs or bypassing rate limits.
* **78. System Initiative**:
  * Experimental, open-source DevOps tool offering a radically different, visual approach to infrastructure management.


## Languages and Frameworks

### Adopt
* **83. OpenTelemetry**: 
  * Standard protocol (OTLP) for handling traces, metrics, and logs, enabling vendor-agnostic observability stacks.
* **84. React Hook Form**:
  * Performant library for building forms in React, favouring uncontrolled components and integrating well with validation schemas.

### Trial
* **85. Effect**:
  * TypeScript library for building complex applications using a functional approach to streamline async, concurrency, state, and error handling.

* **99. Java post-quantum cryptography**:
  * Java's emerging native support (JDK 24+) for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (like lattice-based) for long-term security needs.
* **100. Presidio**:
  * SDK for identifying and anonymizing PII and sensitive data in text using NER and rule-based logic.

### Hold
* **105. Node overload**:
  * Be cautious about defaulting to Node.js without considering alternatives, especially for compute-heavy or data-heavy workloads where other platforms may perform better.
